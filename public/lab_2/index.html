        <h1>Re: Dover Cliff university application</h1>

        Dear Dover,

        <p>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's ischool to study
            for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in<br />
            the following sections.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Starting dates</strong><br /></h2>

        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
            however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a<br />
            semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First Semester: <time datetime="2020-08-29">29 August 2020</time></li>
            <li>Second Semester: <time datetime="2021-01-22">22 January 2021</time></li>
            <li>Third Semester: <time datetime="2021-05-02">2 May 2021</time></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can find more information about 
            <a href="http://umd.edu">important university dates </a>
            on our website.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>

        <p>
            At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility —
            as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies.
            You seem<br /> like a committed researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like
            to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most 
            intrigued<br /> by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F),
                when the audience size exponentially increases<br /> (effect of 3 × 10^3 increasing to 3 × 10^4.)
            </li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long 
            you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other<br /> resources, and anything else
            you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</strong></h2>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study animals.
            To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with<br /> definitions:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
            <dd>A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
            <dt>The elk</dt>
            <dd>
                An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia.
                It can be seen from railways, and also frequently<br /> visits the Banff centre for the arts.
            </dd>
            <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
            <dd>
                An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming 
                noise associated with them on film. This cry is<br /> instead the call of the red-tail.
            </dd>
        </dl>
